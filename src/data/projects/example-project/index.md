This is an example project entry. It demonstrates how project content is structured in the Cybernetic Studio portfolio.

## How it works

Each project lives in its own directory under `src/data/projects/`. The directory contains an `index.md` file with frontmatter metadata and markdown content, along with any co-located images.

## Features

- Markdown content with full formatting support
- Co-located images optimised by Astro
- Frontmatter schema validation via Zod
- Automatic slug generation from directory name
