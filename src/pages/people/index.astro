        <h2>Ben Swift</h2>
        <p class="person-role">Senior Lecturer, ANU School of Cybernetics</p>
        <p>
          Ben Swift leads the Cybernetic Studio. He's a researcher, artist,
          creative technologist and educator whose work spans AI, computational
          art and music, data visualisation, cybernetics and full-stack web
          development. As a livecoding artist, he performs at international
          festivals including ISEA and ICLC&mdash;often as one half of the duo
          Funktion with Ushini Attanayake&mdash;and co-developed the Extempore
          programming environment for musical livecoding. He's also a founding
          co-director of the ANU Laptop Ensemble, and received a Vice
          Chancellor's Citation for Outstanding Contribution to Student Learning
          in 2018. A common thread runs through all his work:
          "liveness"&mdash;human-in-the-loop interactivity with real-time
          feedback. Canberra born and bred, Ben cares deeply about "making
          computing a welcoming, interesting and creatively satisfying place,
          especially for people who don't fit the traditional picture of a
          'computer scientist'."
